        <h1>A CITY IN FLUX</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 10px; letter-spacing: 2px;">A Unified Artistic Vision for St. Louis</p>
    </div>

    <!-- OPENING STATEMENT -->
    <div class="section-content">
        <p><em>St. Louis is a city of transformation—of movement, perception, and reinvention. This proposal is not simply a collection of public art installations; it is a cohesive artistic vision that redefines how people experience the city.</em></p>
        
        <p><em>These three works—The Firework, The Whale, and The Photo Booth—are not separate projects. They are a trilogy of perception, scale, and spectacle that make the city itself feel alive. Each one exists only in the act of viewing—they demand movement, engagement, and shifting perspectives to be fully understood.</em></p>

        <p><em>This is not static public art. This is a redefinition of how we see St. Louis.</em></p>
    </div>

    <!-- THE FINALE -->
    <h2>THE FIREWORK<br><small>A Monument to Celebration & Permanence</small></h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>Suspended in the air at Union Station</p>

        <div class="image-wrapper">
            <img src="image1.jpg" alt="The Finale concept visualization">
        </div>

        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>A breathtaking neon firework explosion, suspended in the air, capturing the energy of a fleeting moment and making it eternal.</p>

        <p>Fireworks are meant to vanish—to explode, then disappear into the night. This installation defies that natural order, freezing the climax of a grand finale and holding it permanently in midair.</p>

        <p>The firework display consists of thousands of layered neon tubes, arranged in a chaotic, dimensional burst. Instead of a static, symmetrical design, this is pure energy—an intricate explosion that feels alive. The placement and scale of the structure create an optical illusion, making the display feel expansive and immersive, as if the moment of a grand finale has been frozen in time. Whether viewed up close or from a distance, it transforms its surroundings, turning any space into a site of perpetual celebration.</p>
        
        <p>While the installation can exist as a standalone piece, it can also be positioned in a location where the skyline is visible behind it, allowing it to become an interruption of the city itself—as if St. Louis is caught in an endless state of celebration.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, a sister firework sculpture could be installed at Westport Plaza, further connecting the properties and creating a dynamic relationship between Union Station and Westport—two locations perpetually illuminated by a celebration that never fades.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Why This Works</h3>
            <ul class="why-this-works">
                <li>It turns impermanence into permanence. A firework should vanish. This one never does.</li>
                <li>It plays with perception. It appears larger than life, even though it is contained.</li>
                <li>It connects locations. A second installation at Westport Plaza would create a visual dialogue between two key city properties.</li>
                <li>It embodies St. Louis as a place of transformation. A city that is always shifting, always celebrating, and always looking toward what’s next.</li>
                
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- THE WHALE -->
    <h2>THE WHALE<br><small>A Monument to Perspective & Form</small></h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>Suspended over the pedestrian bridge at the St. Louis Aquarium</p>

        <div class="image-wrapper">
            <img src="image2.jpg" alt="The Whale concept visualization">
        </div>

        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>An 80-foot-long whale that exists only from certain angles.</p>

        <p>This massive sculpture is composed of razor-thin, two-dimensional metal minnows, all aligned in the same direction. From certain viewpoints, the whale appears to be fully visible—floating, suspended, undeniable. But from other angles, it completely disappears, as if it was never there.</p>

        <p>This is a piece that refuses to be understood from a single vantage point. It forces movement, interaction, and discovery. It is a ghost, a mirage—a fleeting shape that is only whole for a moment, then gone again.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Why This Works</h3>
            <ul class="why-this-works">
                <li>It is an optical event. You don’t just look at it—you have to discover it.</li>
                <li>It changes as you move. The form is unstable, shifting, never fully present.</li>
                <li>It embodies transformation. The largest thing in the ocean is made of the smallest, and here, it barely exists at all.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- PHOTO BOOTH -->
    <h2>THE PHOTO BOOTH<br><small>A Monument to Identity & Visibility</small></h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>A major free-standing structure at Union Station</p>

        <div class="image-wrapper">
            <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Photo Booth concept visualization">
        </div>

        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>A massive, vertically stacked digital photo strip, made up of 16 enormous, 10-foot-tall screens, forming a towering, minimalistic public artwork.</p>

        <p>This installation takes the familiar concept of a photo booth strip and elevates it to an urban scale. Visitors step into a small, unassuming booth, where a camera captures their images in four sequential frames. Instead of printing out a strip, their photos are instantly projected onto the towering digital screens above, broadcasting their expressions to the entire city.</p>

        <p>The experience is fleeting yet monumental—for a brief moment, a visitor’s face becomes larger than life, as if printed across the skyline.</p>
        
        <p>A sister photobooth could be installed at Westport plaza, further connecting the two iconic properties.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Why This Works</h3>
            <ul class="why-this-works">
                <li>It is an ultra-clean, iconic concept. Sixteen screens. Sixteen faces. That’s it. Minimal, powerful, and striking.</li>
                <li>It transforms personal moments into public art. Everyone who participates becomes a part of the cityscape.</li>
                <li>It is interactive in a way that feels inevitable. No gimmicks, no excess—just the pure act of visibility on a grand scale.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- UNIFIED VISION -->
    <div class="section-content">
        <h2>Why These Three Work Together</h2>
        <ul class="why-this-works">
            <li>They all demand movement. You cannot experience them fully without shifting your position.</li>
            <li>They all play with perception. They reveal, they disappear, they transform.</li>
            <li>They all push St. Louis forward. These are not passive monuments—they are acts of transformation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Together, they turn Union Station and downtown St. Louis into living, shifting landscapes.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- CLOSING STATEMENT -->
    <div class="closing-statement">
        <p>“These works are not just sculptures. They are acts of perception. Each piece demands movement. Each piece refuses to be fully seen from a single vantage point. Together, they transform St. Louis into a city of shifting realities—a city in flux. This is not just public art. This is a new way to see.”</p>
